We have a massive project called UdaPeople, this project has a large lifecycle with many edits
that's why are thinking about using CI/CD pipelines, 
Why CI/CD and what's CI/CD ?
CI/CD means containous Integration, which means our main code repo will always be up-to-date
however CD means containous Deployment to our environments.

Why as a project manager asking to apply this new approach with this project?
Actually CI/CD has many advantages on the developement lifecycle and in the business part too
there is some samples of the advantages of CI/CD
CI/CD provides:

- Catch Compile Errors After Merge:
    which means Less developer time on issues from new developer code and that will save developers time 
    to work on more projects.
- Automate Infrastructure Creation:
    which means Less human error, Faster deployments, and that will help us to get more customers,
    projects and get the customer satisfaction.
- Deploy to Production Without Manual Checks:
    which means Less time to market, that will keep us close the users and customers 
- Automated Rollback Triggered by Job Failure:
    which means quick undo to return production to working state, that will help with stable production
    environment and the manage of errors is more fast and Automated

that last import thing that, that impact of using CI/CD is visable, measurable and very quick 
having such technology will keep our company in the first line, we can do it and move forward

Sincerely,
